# Pride-Flags
This is a small program to just have pride flags in your terminal. It's far from perfect and only relies on some basic C code. 
The colors for the flags may vary from terminal to terminal on various OSes. But for reference these wre done with
the MATE terminal under Fedora Linux MATE Spin.
# How to Install
Clone the repository `$ git clone https://github.com/itst3k/pride-flags`

Install it `$ sudo make install`
